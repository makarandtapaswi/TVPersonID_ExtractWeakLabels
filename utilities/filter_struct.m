function [ s ] = filter_struct( s, varargin )
%FILTER_STRUCT Only keep specified fields of a structure
%   S = FILTER_STRUCT(S, field1, ...) returns a new structure, which only keeps
%   the fields specified as parameters.  Nested fields can be specified 
%   via dots, i.e 'a.b.c', which will then only keep a.b.c and remove all other
%   neighbours of a, a.b and a.b.c.
%
%   Example:
%   >> s = struct('a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', struct('k', 1, 'j', 3));
%   >> s = filter_struct(s, 'a', 'c.j')
%   s = 
%       a: 1
%       c.j: 3
